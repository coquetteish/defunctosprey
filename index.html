											<h2>Osprey</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In the words of others, not mine. 
										Osprey is a vanilla SMP community with over 1500 members. Osprey is home to a loyal community and a family. Osprey is a place where people would come to enjoy themselves. Osprey served as a mental anchor when times got tough. Osprey was that family member who annoys you all the time, but you love them all the same. Osprey is that blinding memory, the streak of nostalgia of when times were dark. Osprey is that distant dream in which you were happy. Since March of 2020, Osprey was a gathering place for people of all ages. A gathering place where the young meet the old, and the smart meet the retards. It was a place where you could be you, a place where it truly felt like home.

								<p class="content">Osprey was a very successful server. 
                  Credit is due where credit is due. There are no other Minecraft Realm servers with these statistics, much less a successful one. Osprey has had its fair share of drama, but the fact that Osprey stood so long is nothing but a testament to its community. Love Osprey or hate Osprey, the undeniable fact is that Osprey was successful.</p>

									<h2>What happened?</h2>
									<p>It's a culmination of things. Osprey was never at its peak again after the Yosho drama. There's a lot of things that contributed it to the downfall of Osprey, from toxicity, continual season resets, doxxing, nukings, mismangements, betrayal, grooming, and the works. It's all in the past, and the best thing we can do is look on into the future where there are greener pastures. Osprey was a great thing, and still lives on today. After Bosscore was banned, rosey set up a community discord where everyone can connect to each other even after the downfall of Osprey. I hope you'll join us. Down below are attached some archives of the actual discord itself. Pets and General were too large, so I've attached their html in an mediafire link. They will be sent </p>

							<h2>Closing thoughts by krat</h2>
							<p>Osprey was never perfect in its own right. It was never claimed so. Osprey was my home. It was where I kept my sanity during the long times of covid. I can't speak for others, but Osprey will always be part of who I am. Thanks to Osprey, I've found a new interest in owning servers of my own, and learning development as a whole to further my own career. I guess it's not far fetched to even say that Osprey has saved my life. yall were there at my highest and my lows. you guys have seen me at my best and me at my worst. It sounds corny yeah, but you people are honestly some of the best friends i have ever made online. To the outside world, it may seem as if Osprey is just another discord server, another minecraft server. Osprey has changed hundreds of lives, and it has brought people together in a way i've never seen before. I cannot thank anymore more than the people in osprey, the community, the admins, the players. I cannot thank kevin enough for being the best owner, and a person that I look up to as one of my seniors. thanks for teaching me and providing a home to over 1500 people. You guys are why Osprey will leave a legacy behind. Osprey will not be forgotten. I hope it will return one day. This website is my tribute to what osprey is and what it means to me, and i sincerely hope that it means the same to me as it does you. i love you all, and i'll see you guys again.</p>
